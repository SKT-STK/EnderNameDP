adds a player specific enderpearl,
allows you to shoot it out from a dispenser or tp another player even tho you thew it,
you can craft it by joining together an enderpearl and a piece of paper in the crafting bench,
the enderpearl will be "attached" to the player that crafted it,
in case of getting crafted by an autocrafter its just a normal enderpearl with a diff texture - doesnt work,

!!!IMPORTANT!!! THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (EnderNameRP)
